Local Storage and Cookies

- Using localStorage and sessionStorage, Cookies
- Storing and retrieving data


When it's done Let's create a demo for it
Create a simple To-Do List web application that allows users to:
Add, view, and delete tasks.
Choose where to store the tasks: localStorage, sessionStorage, or cookies.
Demonstrate the persistence and behavior of each storage mechanism (e.g., localStorage persists across sessions, sessionStorage clears when the tab closes, cookies have size and expiration constraints).
Display retrieved data and allow users to clear storage.
This demo will help illustrate:
How to store and retrieve data using localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies.
Key differences (persistence, scope, size limits).
Practical use cases for each storage type.
